## My process

### Built with
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - Component Library
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

So first time using Next.js and Chakra UI to build a site based on an existing design. Was a good practice as I was able to learn quite alot about the frameworks. Honestly not sure if it was necessary for this particular site, but it was a good practice and I will probably try out this combination for my next few solutions too. It would be too much if I were to go into detail about everything I learnt so here are some of the key points:
- using [custom themes](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/customize-theme) to extend the base Chakra UI theme, basically acts like a base stylesheet.
- SVGs can be imported as the Box component and used as icons, which I quite like. More can be found on this [guide](https://dev.to/studio_hungry/chakra-ui-external-link-with-svg-icon-12e5).
- still trying to get a hang of responsive images, especially srcset. Ended up using the picture tag instead as it was easier to understand and implement. 
  
There's still quite a lot , but mostly directed towards Chakra UI and it's specifics. 

### Continued development

I probably won't develop this any further. 

### Useful resources

- [www.internetingishard.com](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-images/) - I feel this is my favourite guide on responsive images so far. 
- [dev.to](https://dev.to/studio_hungry/chakra-ui-external-link-with-svg-icon-12e5) - This helped me figure out how to use svg as icons in chakra ui.
